The Python Connect 4 Game Github repo is an implementation of the classic Connect 4 game in Python. The game is designed to be played on the terminal and allows two players to take turns placing their colored disks on a grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to connect four disks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

The game is built using Python's standard libraries and implements an object-oriented design. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it a great resource for those looking to learn Python programming or object-oriented design concepts.
